Getting Started with High-Performance Computing
================================================

**There are no specific prerequisite courses or high-performance computing (HPC) experience required before using XXXX.** However, if you are unfamiliar with using an HPC cluster, it is highly recommended that you take NCSA’s short tutorial `Using an HPC Cluster for Scientific Applications <https://www.hpc-training.org/moodle/enrol/index.php?id=71>`_ before continuing.

Browse NCSA’s `HPC-Moodle <https://www.hpc-training.org>`_ for a full list of HPC training opportunities including self-paced tutorials and training events (in-person and virtual).
